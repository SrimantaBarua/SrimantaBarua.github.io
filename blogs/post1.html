<p>Yeah you read that right. Don't believe me? <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4806254493958144">Here</a> you go. I'll be talking more in detail about the project in the <a onclick="scroll_to_id('post3')">next post</a>. This one is more about the whole process of applying, getting selected, and stuff like that.</p>
<p>I'd always wanted to apply for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">GSoC</a>. It's just that things never lined up. Plus I never really believed that I was good enough to get selected. Nevertheless, I spent most of the winter break studying the code for <a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2">radare2</a>, in the hopes that they would be selected for GSoC this year, like last year. I had recently started venturing into the field of reverse engineering, and that's how I was introduced to radare2 (since I can't afford an IDA license).</p>
<p>It was tough, initially. I had never worked on a big project with other people. Plus, the radare2 code-base is updated at a very fast rate, so the talk in the organization is along the lines of <em>"There IS documentation. It's in C."</em> Plus, I couldn't quite figure out where to start. Disheartened, I put radare2 on hold for the time.</p>
<p>Fast forward to February, when almost everyone in Crux (the coding club at college) was talking about which orgs they were contributing to, and hoping to apply to. After a few conversations with people whose opinions mattered, I decided to give radare2 another go. I searched through the "Easy" issues for one that seemed achievable. Fortunately, I found <a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2/issues/6795">#6795</a>, which was about cross references not being deleted. After some diffing around (was it a week?), I made my first every pull request (<a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2/pull/6820">#6820</a>). You know how there are some milestones in your life that you have to tick off? First girlfriend, first kiss, first test failed.. well this was up there and I was super happy the whole day.</p>
<p>I quickly followed it up with a one-line fix (<a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2/pull/6834">#6834</a>). And then it took some time for the next (<a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2/pull/6902">#6902</a>) which I consider my first serious fix. By  this point, I'd started talking to a few people within the org, though I spent most of my time reading the conversations, which admittedly are pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Now I moved on the the next stage, which was seriously thinking about my GSoC application. radare2 had put up a list of ideas for GSoC/RSoC '17, and based on that, I found the idea for a <em>gdbserver implementation inside radare2</em> pretty interesting, and that's what I went for.  I sent in a pull request fixing some bugs in the existing gdb client implementation, to get familiar with the source code, and started chalking out a tentative plan of action, which then helped me in writing my application. Got it reviewed by a few people within the org, sent it in a day before the deadline, and sat there with my fingers crossed from 23<sup>r2</sup> April to 4<sup>th</sup> May, waiting for the result.</p>
<p>And well, yeah, I got selected. Yay.</p>
