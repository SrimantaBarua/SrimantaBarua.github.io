<p>Hi. I'm Srimanta Barua, as the title conveniently tells you. And okay, I know this looks ugly.
But I'm not a web developer.</p>
<p><em>Why not use a site generator?</em></p>
<p>Well, I tried. Then I realized that with this, like everything else I work on, I feel
uncomfortable working without understanding everything about what's going on under the hood. And
so, I decided that I needed to try my hand at web development, even if only for a few days. And
this is the result of what I've learnt in the last four days. So yeah, do expect a lot of stuff to
change over the next month or so, as I learn of better ways to do things.</p>
<p><em>Fair enough. So why did you start a blog, again?</em></p>
<p>I've always wanted to broadcast to the world about stuff I learn in the course of my random
experiments. That's probably why I love teaching too.. telling people about "stuff they don't teach
you  in school". So I've always wanted to write a blog, but never got around to doing so.</p>
<p><em>And then,</em> I got selected for GSoC '17 with <a href="https://radare.org">radare2</a>.</p>
<p><a onclick="scroll_to_id('post2')">I'll be talking about that in a later post.</a> But the point
is, GSoC students are expected to maintain a blog to document their work, their difficulties, stuff
they've learnt, etc. And I found the perfect excuse to finally buy that domain name, and start my
blog with free hosting on GitHub pages.</p>
<p>This "blog" is just starting out now. There's not much to see. But I hope to write fairly
regularly, whenever I have stuff to share. So hopefully it won't be so bare for long. Plus I hope
it will be much better looking, a month or so from  now.</p>
<p>It promises to be an interesting summer.</p>
