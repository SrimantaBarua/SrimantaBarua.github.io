<p><strong>bed</strong> is a text editor I am writing in Rust. It uses GLFW and OpenGL for
rendering, FreeType for rastering text, and HarfBuzz to shape text. On Linux, it uses Fontconfig to
search for fonts. Uses DirectWrite on Windows.</p>

<p>As of now, it can read and write files, and supports basic syntax highlighting for C, Rust, and
TOML. It has Vim-style keybindings by default (though I haven't implemented a way to remap keys),
and is configured with a YAML config file. I've also implemented a "fuzzy search" for files within
the current working directory, which could be re-used to support other operations that would benefit
from fuzzy search.</p>
